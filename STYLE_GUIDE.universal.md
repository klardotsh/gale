## Legal Comments

"Why, oh why," you might ask, "does every single file in this source tree start
with a header comment reminding me that it is released under the Zero-Clause
BSD License, distributed blah blah blah?"

Great question.

Mostly, it serves to remind anyone reading the file that they can do,
effectively, whatever they want with it. This is not a given in western legal
systems (and in particular, in the US), and since the spirit of gluumy is to
freely copy files around into monorepos or forks, and generally to have
complete flexibility in how files are structured (or unstructured...) on disk,
it helps ensure a file that floats away from this repo still reminds the user
that it is not encumbered.

As an extension of the above, it serves as a bit of a repetitive broadcast of
@klardotsh's general disdain for enforcing (or trying to enforce) software
licenses (believe it or not, I used to be a GPL die-hard), for restrictive and
absurdly-long-lived copyright law (my life plus 70 years by US law), and for
"intellectual property" as a concept. Separating the code from any pay related
to the time spent writing it is a model I want to explore and see explored more
in software.
